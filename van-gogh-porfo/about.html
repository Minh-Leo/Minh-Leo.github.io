            Van Gogh never stopped conjuring in words the landscapes, portraits,
            and interiors that he had painted or planned to paint. Later
            letters, especially during his period in Provence after 1888,
            intersperse striking verbal evocations of trees, skies, fields,
            faces, even a humble bed or chair, with inset sketches—“croquis,” he
            called them. They would bloom into many of the best-known, and
            deeply-cherished, pictures in the canon of Western art. Posterity
            has adored the image-maker but ignored the writer and thinker behind
            them

            Foggy Victorian London, where literature far outshone in status both
            the visual arts and music, helped make Van Gogh the artist he became
            and remained, even when the golden fields and cobalt skies of
            Provence blazed across his canvases.

            We know of only around twenty drawings completed in England—the best
            of them an earnest but still plodding sketch of the Dutch church at
            Austin Friars in the City of London, where the would-be evangelist
            sometimes worshipped.

            He adored long contemplative walks, and wrote wonderfully about what
            he saw and felt on them. In a letter, he captured for his beloved
            younger brother the river as it “reflected the large chestnut trees
            with their load of yellow leaves and the clear blue sky, and between
            the treetops the part of Richmond that lies on the hill, the houses
            with their red roofs and windows without curtains and green gardens…
            and below, the grey bridge with tall poplars on either side.”
